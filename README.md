# EXPLORUM

Here I am attempting to build a relatively basic full stack application usingRuby on Rails, in order to practice its use and build upon my
understanding of the framework.

**Specs and setup**

Ruby version: 2.6.3

Dependencies setup:

- Fork and clone this repo
- Run 'bundle install' within the root

DB setup:

- rails db:create
- rails db:migrate

Test procedure:

- run 'rspec'

**User Stories**

```

Because I am looking for a site to log my thoughts
I wish to visit the Explorum via the airlock

```
As a User
As I need an incentive to be a User
I wish for posts to allow more characters when signed on
[status: complete]

So I can further engage with the posts of others

[status: complete]
```

As a User
So I can follow conversations
I wish to be able to view all comments under a post

As a User
So I can get it right when engaging with other posts
I wish to be able to delete my comments, but not others
[status: in progress]
```

I'm also hoping to properly understand and apply SASS in order to improve the look and feel of the web application.
However, I'm also crucially hoping to continue working on user stories and features.
