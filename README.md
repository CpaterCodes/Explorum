# EXPLORUM

Here I am attempting to build a relatively basic full stack
application using Ruby on Rails

**Specs and setup**

Ruby version: 2.6.3

Dependencies setup:

- Fork and clone this repo
- Run 'bundle install' within the root

DB setup:

- rails db:create
- rails db:migrate

Test procedure:

- run 'rspec'

**Current objectives**

```
As a User
Because I am looking for a sit to log my thoughts
I wish to visit the Explorum via the airlock [status: complete]
```

```
As a User
So that I may express my desire to leave a message to the world
I wish to make posts [status: in progress]
```

```
As a User
So that I may witness the messages and chatter of others
I wish to see all posts [status: pending]
```
